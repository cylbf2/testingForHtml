00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:11.460
Behold the multitude.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.420
This is a desert place, and
now the time is far passed:

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810
send them away, that they
may go into the villages,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.478
and buy themselves bread.

00:00:47.478 --> 00:00:51.120
They have nothing to eat.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.869
Give ye them to eat.

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.035
Shall we go and buy two
hundred pennyworth of bread,

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:57.526
and give them to eat?

00:00:57.526 --> 00:00:59.360
How many loaves have ye?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.095
Five, and two fishes.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.660
Bring them to me.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.930
Divide the people into
companies of fifty,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.200
that they might be fed.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.800
O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.530
I thank thee for thy bounties.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080
Amen.
